# Overview #
A Habit Tracker web application that can be deployed on a local Flask server.
The application uses the free Pixela API to create a graphical representation of a particular habit on a daily basis, similar to the GitHub contributions graph preset on a profile's dashboard.
Currently, the application only has one graph tracking hours spent coding.

# Future Improvvements/Ideas #
- Add more graph functionality other that simply adding a pixel, e.g. deleting pixels, changing a pixel's unit, etc.
- Allow for multiple graphs and add the functionality to manage all of them
- Streamline the account creation process using the Pixela API
